The classic game of Hangman, built in Vue. Uses strikes for the wrong guesses rather than the traditional illustration because, while the latter is arguably a little more whimsical, it also hasn't aged well, to put it mildly. But there are around 100 puzzles available with the default settings! When you successfully guess the quote it redirects you to a newspaper page that you can edit to say any news you want

Adjust the puzzle length and number of allowed strikes for new and interesting challenges (or to just make it impossible to lose). üòÅ
